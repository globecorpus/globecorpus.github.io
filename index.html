      <p>This paper introduces GLOBE, a high-quality English corpus with worldwide accents, specifically designed to address the limitations of current zero-shot speaker adaptive Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems that exhibit poor generalizability in adapting to speakers with accents. Compared to commonly used English corpora, such as LibriTTS and VCTK, GLOBE is unique in its inclusion of utterances from 23,519 speakers and covers 164 accents worldwide, along with detailed metadata for these speakers. Compared to its original corpus, i.e., Common Voice, GLOBE significantly improves the quality of the speech data through rigorous filtering and enhancement processes, while also populating all missing speaker metadata. The final curated GLOBE corpus includes 535 hours of speech data at a 24 kHz sampling rate. Our benchmark results indicate that the speaker adaptive TTS model trained on the GLOBE corpus can synthesize speech with better speaker similarity and comparable naturalness than that trained on other popular corpora. We will release GLOBE publicly after acceptance.</p>

      <h2 id="abstract">4. Conclusion<a name="abstract"></a></h2>
      <p>This paper introduces GLOBE, a high-quality English corpus featuring worldwide accents originating from Common Voice, aimed at addressing the poor generalizability issue of current zero-shot speaker-adaptive TTS models. GLOBE not only matches the audio quality of popular TTS datasets like LibriTTS but also surpasses them by covering a broader range of worldwide accents and offering metadata for an extensive array of over 20,000 speakers. Our experiments demonstrate that speaker-adaptive TTS models trained on GLOBE achieve better generalizability than those trained on other datasets. We hope that the release of GLOBE will contribute to advancements in TTS research.</p>
